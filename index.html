                <p class="section-text">Ever since I laid eyes on my first Game Boy back in 1998, I fell in love - not only with video games, but technology as a whole. Back then at age 8, I had no idea what hardware and software was. To me, this was a magical rectangle that provided hours upon hours of fun that I could not put down. In essence, it was the driving force that kindled my love and passion for technology. As I grew older, that passion was fueled by the success stories of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Netflix, and Google. It was later in college - after taking my first introduction to programming course - that my pursuit of software development was cemented. For personal and financial reasons I had to put my studies on hold. That said, my incumbency in this institution garnered me a certificate in Web Programming under the Computer Information Systems program. Currently, I am continuing my education through self-learning using the internet as my repository for knowledge and skills-building. As I stand now, I have a fundamental understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript as well as working knowledge of C++ - all of which have made me versed well enough to improve and grow with the aid of a mentor.</p>
